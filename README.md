# Key-Points-Detection
Keypoint Detection stands as a fundamental and core task in the realm of computer vision. This task involves the identification of semantically significant points within an image, ultimately yielding the coordinates of these points. The complete process of keypoint detection encompasses various stages: dataset annotation, deep learning algorithm training, performance evaluation, inference and prediction, as well as application deployment. Whether you're a novice or an experienced computer vision enthusiast, this README provides insights into the key aspects of the keypoint detection pipeline. From understanding the importance of dataset annotation to mastering the training of deep learning models, this repository aims to guide you through each stage of the keypoint detection journey. Feel free to explore the provided resources, codes, and documentation. :)
